                            Increasing your online presence has been an important part of marketing for some time, but now it is more important than ever. Fewer people are shopping physically due to the pandemic and are instead resorting to online shopping. Building a website will give people a place to interact with your company during quarantine.

                                <li>Make sure not to focus only on design when creating a website. The reason why small business websites often do not create a return on investment is because they are often more focused on looks rather than sales principles.</li>
                                <li>Make it very, very easy to do one thing - schedule an appointment, buy a product, make a reservation, etc. Too many options or too much complexity can confuse customers.</li>
                                <li>Do not make a website “just so you can have one”. Make it work for you - otherwise, it is useless.</li>
                                <li>Some platforms that may be helpful in creating an effective website that fulfills your needs are <a href="https://wix.com">Wix</a>, <a href="https://squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>, and <a href="https://site123.com">Site123</a>.</li>
