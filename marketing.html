                            Increasing your online presence has been an important part of marketing for some time, but now it is more important than ever. Fewer people are shopping physically due to the pandemic and are instead resorting to online shopping. Building a website will give people a place to interact with your company during quarantine. 
                            <ul class="browser-default">
                                <li>Make sure not to focus only on design when creating a website. The reason why small business websites often do not create a return on investment is because they are often more focused on looks rather than sales principles.</li>
                                <li>Make it very, very easy to do one thing - schedule an appointment, buy a product, make a reservation, etc. Too many options or too much complexity can confuse customers.</li>
                                <li>Do not make a website “just so you can have one”. Make it work for you - otherwise, it is useless.</li>
                                <li>Some platforms that may be helpful in creating an effective website that fulfills your needs are <a href="https://wix.com">Wix</a>, <a href="https://squarespace.com">Squarespace</a>, and <a href="https://site123.com">Site123</a>.</li>

                            Sales and discounts are a proven manner in which you can encourage customers to purchase goods or services. Utilizing them now is as important as ever.

                                <li>They allow customers to get acquainted with new online methods of doing business.</li>
                                <li>It also enables customers to see that your business is still functioning once they make a purchase and is there to help them, instilling confidence in the customer. This can be crucial for customer retention and future sales, both in this time of crisis and afterwards.</li>
