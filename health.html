                        COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness with sustained community transmission in
                        several countries, including the United States(majority of cases are not imported). The official
                        name of of the virus is "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"(SARS-CoV-2). It is
                        currently theorized the virus originated in Wuhan, China in November 2019.

                            It is believed that COVID-19 spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with one
                            another (within 6 feet of each other) via small airborne droplets that are produced when an
                            infected person coughs or sneezes. A person can also get COVID-19 by touching a surface or
                            object that has the virus on it and then touching their face.

                            Most people who have COVID-19 will experience mild symptoms similar to those of the common
                            cold or flu. Some people may not experience any symptoms at all. The most common symptoms
                            include but are not limited to:

                            Most people will survive their infection without requiring any medical treatment. On the

                            There are many precautions you can take to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Most of these
                            are standard hygiene practices that apply to many diseases:

                                <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an
                                    alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water
                                    are not available.</li>

                            Symptoms can appear 2-14 days after you have been exposed to the virus. If you are
                            experiencing any symptoms it is advised to:

                                <li>Encourage sick employees to stay at home until they have been fever-free for 24
                                    hours without taking any fever reduction medicines. Encourage minimal contact

                                    or to return to work. Many doctor’s offices and medical facilities will be extremely
                                    busy during this time and may not be able to provide timely documentation. If an

                                    respiratory hygiene by using tissues when coughing or sneezing, as well as washing
                                    hands often.

                                    as doorknobs and counters. Visible efforts at disinfection can leave a positive
