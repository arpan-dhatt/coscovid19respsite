</li>
<li>Virtual Interaction</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>Productivity Trackers</li>
<li>

<li>Project Management Tools</li>
<li>
<ul><li>Maintaining a normal workflow and communicating everyone's roles and tasks can be challenging when working remotely. That’s why it's important to use some project management tools so each employee knows what to do, and when. They also enable management to have better oversight over how employees are functioning. Some good project management tools include Trello, Basecamp, Asana, Airtable or Monday.com. These applications both allow managers to view a list of pre-planned goals and steps in order to achieve them, to ensure that even when working remotely, a clear agenda for all employees is set. </li></ul>
