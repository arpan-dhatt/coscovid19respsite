                    Investing in an online method of selling goods is not only necessary for the COVID-19 induced
                    restrictions, but is also important as it helps your business adapt to changing business realities
                    of the future.

                        <li>Set up an e-commerce presence. This can happen in two ways.
                            E-commerce will help bypass the seller and allow you to keep a higher portion of
                            the profits for your business.
                            <ul class="browser-default">
                                <li>Utilize online resources such <a href="wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, <a

                                    others to create your own e-commerce store.

                            Both are good choices; a decision should be made based off of the position of your company.

                        <li>Ensure a delivery mechanism is set up:

                                <li>This can include getting boxes, packaging tape, etc., and training staff in
                                    packaging and sending out orders.
                                </li>
                                <li>This also includes finding a provider such as <a href="ups.com">UPS</a> or <a

                                    integrating their system with your business.

                        <li>Ensure that your website is optimized for search engines. By doing this, it is more likely a
                            potential customer will choose your website over another. There are many services online
                            that can help with this:

                <h5>Online Avenues for Services</h5>
                <p>Not all services are able to be conducted online. However, those that are should take advantage of
                    e-commerce. Businesses encompass a whole host of industries that do not require physical interaction
                    with customers. Lawyers, real estate agents, and tutors can all utilize online platforms to interact
                    with customers and manage workflow from home.
