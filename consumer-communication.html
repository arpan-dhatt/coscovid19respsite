                        <p>Other than creating email chains with customers that have already uploaded their emails into
                            a rewards program or made an account with the business, companies should also be creating
                            social media platforms, such as Instagram, to communicate certain health initiatives that
                            they are taking to better meet the needs of their customers. Actively communicating this
                            information is vital, as it makes consumers feel more comfortable purchasing goods or
                            relying on the services provided by the business as they would know that measures are being
                            taken to keep products and workers healthy and safe.</p>
                        <p>In addition to including updates about new health initiatives taking place, a social media
                            platform would also be a good place for businesses to promote new products or services.</p>

                        <p>Expressing involvement within the community shows that the business is not only making
                            reforms within their own walls, but in other areas as well. Staying involved in the
                            community can take numerous forms, including but not limited to:
                            <ul class="browser-default">
                                <li>Actively taking part in donations to a non-profits or NGOs: Businesses could also
                                    donate a certain percentage of the proceeds they earn in a designated time frame to
                                    a local homeless shelter. This is similar to when local clubs seek funding, aka
                                    gaining a portion of a businessâ€™s profits made in an allotted time frame.

                                <li>If your business is in the food service industry, you could participate in or
                                    sponsor a food drive along with other local businesses. </li>

                        </p>
                        <p>These actions could be shared on the social media platform discussed above, and would create
                            a collective and communal sense of trust towards the business. Consumers are more willing to
                            buy from businesses they believe care about the well-being of their customers and community,
                            particularly during times of crisis.
