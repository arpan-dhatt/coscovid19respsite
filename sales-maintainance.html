                        <p>Many individuals see themselves furloughed or with reduced hours for the foreseeable future, however, they still maintain their jobs and will continue to earn their normal wages once this crisis blows over. Thus, enabling them to simply defer payments has less risk and the benefit of maintaining sales in this economic downturn.</p>
                        <p>Payment deferals can look like allowing customers to pay in multiple installments, or allowing them to pay the full cost of a product in a few months once the pandemic had been dealt with.</p>

                        <p>Consumers have significantly changed the way in which they purchase goods due to the various travel restrictions and advisories in place. Many have switched to purchasing from e-commerce sites to continue the policy of social distancing. In order for your business to remain competitive and widen its range, it is imperative the internet is used for sales.

                        <p>In addition, this switch has two main benefits.</p>

                                Firstly, it allows the staff of the business to remain productive in an environment in which they might not have other things to do.

                            <li>
                                Secondly, it has the added benefit of setting up a strong foundation for growth after COVID-19 passes. It has already emerged as a trend that individuals are shifting away from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce platforms, and crises in the past have shown that COVID-19 is only set to increase the consumersâ€™ acceptance and use of online channels of business.

                    <div class="collapsible-body">
                        <p>Restaurants specifically should look to delivery services such as Uber Eats, Grubhub, and DoorDash to maintain sales. These services have seen a 56% rise in use over the past two weeks - consumers still want to eat out, but cannot leave the house due to COVID-19. Offering food delivery solves this issue and also sets up your restaurant for future growth once this crisis ends.</p>

                        <p>Although not possible for all service sectors, it may be an option to send your service to the customer via the internet through platforms such as Google Hangouts, Microsoft teams, or gotomeeting, etc. Some of these platforms are currently offering free promotions specifically targeted at small businesses to ensure a smooth transition from traditional to remote working options. Although not a substitute for face-to-face interaction, it allows you to retain business and shows customers that you are working hard to persevere through the crisis.</p>
