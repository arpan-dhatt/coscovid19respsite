Thus, enabling them to simply defer payments has less risk and the benefit of maintaining sales in this economic downturn.</p>
                        <p>Payment deferals can look like allowing customers to pay in multiple installments, or allowing them to pay the full cost of a product in a few months once the pandemic had been dealt with.</p>

                        <p>Consumers have significantly changed the way in which they purchase goods due to the various travel restrictions and advisories in place. Many have switched to purchasing from e-commerce sites to continue the policy of social distancing. In order for your business to remain competitive and widen its range, it is imperative the internet is used for sales.

                                Secondly, it has the added benefit of setting up a strong foundation for growth after COVID-19 passes. It has already emerged as a trend that individuals are shifting away from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce platforms, and crises in the past have shown that COVID-19 is only set to increase the consumers’ acceptance and use of online channels of business.

Offering food delivery solves this issue and also sets up your restaurant for future growth once this crisis ends.</p>

                            Increasing your online presence has been an important part of marketing for some time, but now it is more important than ever.

                                <li>Make sure not to focus only on design when creating a website. The reason why small business websites often do not create a return on investment is because they are often more focused on looks rather than sales principles.</li>
                                <li>Make it very, very easy to do one thing - schedule an appointment, buy a product, make a reservation, etc. Too many options or too much complexity can confuse customers.</li>
