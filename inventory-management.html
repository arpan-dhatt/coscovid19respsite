                            <li>The government has advised both individuals and companies against hoarding and buying supplies in large quantities in the short term. This practice leads to uncertainty and shortages, two things that will slow down the rate of crisis recovery.</li>
                            <li><b>When purchasing from domestic suppliers, avoid massive orders that are greater than normal, and do not hoard supplies for the future.</b></li>
                            <li>However, when purchasing supplies from international sources, it is advisable to stock up on supplies for the future. International supply chains are being disrupted, and changing demand patterns across the world are causing logistics and transport to become more expensive and unpredictable.</li>

                            <li>Some goods, ranging from fitness equipment to bread, are in high demand due to COVID-19. In order to ensure equity, whenever goods sold by your business are in high demand, it is recommended that products be rationed to a certain amount per customer to prevent hoarding and to ensure everyone has access to those products.</li>
                            <li>Your business can also create waitlists for individuals to receive products as soon as the next shipment arrives, which ensures that everyone has a fair chance of obtaining products.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On the flip side, demand for other products has gone down significantly due to COVID-19. If the inventory does not decompose over time, it is advisable to save it for use after COVID-19 passes, but if it decomposes, it is important not to let it go to waste.</p>

                            <li>This can be accomplished by offering discounts on low-demand products, communicating these discounts to customers <a href="marketing.html">(see marketing tips)</a>, and distributing them in an online manner.</li>
                            <li>As a last resort, it is recommended to donate low-demand products to support individuals or organizations in need and also gain positive publicity for your business. See more <a href="consumer-communication.html">here</a>.</li>

                        <p>COVID-19 has been shown to last on surfaces such as cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours. If possible, leave all incoming shipments untouched for that period of time. Alternatively, before interaction, shipments can be wiped down with disinfectant to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
                        <p> <b>It is also advisable to use gloves and a mask when interacting with both incoming and outgoing shipments to ensure the virus does not spread.</b></p>
